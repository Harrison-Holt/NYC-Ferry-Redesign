# Redesigning the NYC Ferry App

This accessibility-focused redesign project aimed to improve the NYC Ferry App for users with disabilities, particularly those with visual and cognitive impairments. We applied inclusive design principles and WCAG compliance to create a more usable, equitable digital transit experience.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Improve accessibility for visually impaired and cognitively disabled users.
- Simplify navigation and reduce cognitive overload on key pages.
- Ensure compatibility with screen readers and other assistive technologies.
- Integrate WCAG 2.1 AA compliant features across the user interface.

---

## 🚩 Key Issues Identified

During our design audit and user feedback sessions, several barriers were identified:

- ❌ **Cluttered Home Page**: Overwhelming amount of information leading to cognitive overload.
- ❌ **Poor Contrast Ratios**: Color schemes failed to meet accessibility standards.
- ❌ **No Screen Reader Support**: Critical navigation elements were skipped or mislabeled.
- ❌ **Inaccessible Maps**: Confusing icons and lack of textual labeling made it hard to use ferry route maps.
- ❌ **No Accessibility Settings**: No way to enable high-contrast mode, adjust font sizes, or toggle auditory feedback.

## ✨ Redesign Highlights

- ✅ **High-Contrast UI**: Updated color palette for better readability and compliance with WCAG contrast requirements.
- ✅ **Adjustable Text Size**: Users can customize font size based on preference or need.
- ✅ **Screen Reader & Auditory Feedback**: Implemented ARIA labels and voice prompts for essential navigation.
- ✅ **Simplified Navigation Flow**: Restructured homepage and menus to prioritize key actions.
- ✅ **Location-Based Assistance**: Terminal directions and route maps are GPS-enhanced with clear, accessible labels.

## 📊 Design Audit Summary

A full accessibility audit was conducted using tools like:

- WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool)
- Axe DevTools
- Manual keyboard navigation and screen reader testing

### Findings

| Category | Issue | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Homepage | Information overload | Resolved |
| Contrast | Failed WCAG 2.1 contrast checks | Improved |
| Navigation | Poor hierarchy, missing ARIA | Improved |
| Route Maps | Overlapping icons and poor labels | Redesigned |
| Settings | No accessibility options | Added |

## 🧪 Usability Testing & Evaluation

We conducted usability testing with 5 participants using:

- **Screen Readers** (NVDA, VoiceOver)
- **Zoom/Magnifier Tools**
- **Keyboard-only Navigation**

### Results:

- **Task completion rate:** Increased by 70%
- **Navigation success:** Improved from 50% → 95%
- **User satisfaction:** Rated 4.5/5 for clarity and ease of use
- **Perceived inclusiveness:** All users felt the app was more accessible and intuitive
